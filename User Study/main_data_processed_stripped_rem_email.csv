This makes it stop and move back and position itself on the side.,Somewhat disagree,There are two options of this intention. One is that robot recongizes humans and when one is detected it goes into standby mode on the side.

It's not very easy to understand as when it is moving forward. The lights are static but with every other motion the lights are making some pattern of some sort.,The mower has realised the person moving in front of it and adjusted it's speed so that it does not collide with the person.,Somewhat disagree,I think the robot was merely taking avoidant action and this didn't need the human to be aware of it in any way. The question above is evaluating if there was any form of communication that was directed towards the human.,Not at all,The mower seems to be trying to signal to the person to move aside so that it can vacumn where they are standing. It does this by the repeated back and forth motion.,Strongly agree,"The robot is showing that it is eager to move ahead and does this by showing that it acknowledges the barrier but is also trying to access the place the person is on.
The question is trying to deduct if I think the robot is trying to actively communicate something with the user.","Yes, the lights show the motion that the vacumn is in.

I think it is supposed to avoid the human and vacumn around them.

The robot moves off to the side as if to let the moving object continue on its path before resuming mowing,","I think it is important. It demonstrates that the robot can potentially differentiate between living and non-living beings, or at least between a stationary object and a moving one.

It still needs to continue mowing that part of the ""lawn"", but can do so at a slower pace to accommodate the object in motion in front of it.","This is important because it again demonstrates that it recognizes when there is an object in motion, and work to accommodate this while still performing its task.","The mower beings by moving forward in a straight line, but stops and reverses a small distance when it encounters a person.

Once it came within a certain range of the person it slowed down to match the person's speed.,Somewhat agree,"Here it's not as crystal clear to me (like in the previous video) that the mower was adjusting its behaviour to account for the person. Probably because only the speed of the mower changed. It didn't make any other manuveurs to avoid the person.

This is evident in the way it behaves,It is important but I don't agree on the way it's behaving.
